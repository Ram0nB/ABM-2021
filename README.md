Agent-based Modelling Project

To run the model:
1. go to the folder sugarscape
2. open main.py
3. run the script (you can specify the specific parameters first if you'd like)
  - the output of the model will be saved as a csv file in the folder sugarscape/data
  - the output is a dataframe with the steps taken and the agents sugar levels and position
  - other parameters are saved in the columns as well
  
To visualize the model:
1. go to the folder sugarscape
2. open model_viz.py
3. run the script (you can specify the specific parameters first if you'd like)
  - a browser will be opened with the visualization

To run the sensitivity analysis:
1. run sugarscape/sensitivity_analysis.ipynb

To run the experiments:
1. run sugarscape/run_experiments.ipynb

To analyze the data:
1. run sugarscape/data_analysis.ipynb

To create Amsterdam map from CBS data:
run WealthaDATA/parseCBSdata.ipynb
