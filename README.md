  - the output is a dataframe with the steps taken and the agents sugar levels and position
  - other parameters are saved in the columns as well
  
To visualize the model:
1. go to the folder sugarscape
2. open model_viz.py
3. run the script (you can specify the specific parameters first if you'd like)
  - a browser will be opened with the visualization
